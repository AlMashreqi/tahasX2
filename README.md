Heya,
I created this bot Purely in Python. This Bot has many bugs, But I have already fixed them in a better version. 
That Version has some Additional Features like Cogs, Filters, Music, Leveling System, Economy System.

**Requirements:**
Python 3.7,
discord.py,
corona_api.py

You can Host the Bot on Heroku. I have Already included the Proc File, If you want to host it yourself, Use a .env File.
